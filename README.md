# selfdrivingcarNeuralNetwork

A simulator for a self driving car built using a basic neural network implemented in JS and animated with html canvas. The car that is in the lead will have its sensor drawn and its network visualized on the sidebar.
Use the save button to save a neural network to be mutated and refresh the page to regenerate new iterations based off the last saved network. After several iterations of the test continually selecting the best performing network will soon yield a network that can solve the problem of navigating through traffic without impact.
